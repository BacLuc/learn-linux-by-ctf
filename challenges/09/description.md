# man

`Manpages` are used to describe Linux *commands* and help you understand what s*ettings* and *arguments* can be passed to the program.
 
`man` is very important for daily operation of unix based systems.

You can open `Manpages` locally by directly referencing them after the `man` *command* like:
`man filename`

Keep in mind you can also search in `Manpages`, maybe this will help you.

# Your goal
You need to find the flag hidden in the local created man page.
The flag is hidden between _MeP Options_ and some _endian_ specific settings, happy searching!

# Useful commands
- man
- grep
