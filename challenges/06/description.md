# grep

`grep` is used to *filter* text for occurence of a string! 

This command is very usefull to *filter* large outputs or *search* for text in *files*.

`grep` has some _special characters_ built in called *metacharacters* be very careful when using these as they can 
change the output and *search* of grep dramatically! Look this up on google _grep metacharacters_.

# Your goal
Your are logged in to a system that contains a big file with a lot of garbage in it. 
But there is also some usefull information hidden inbetween the garbage, can you find the flag?
Hint: it's hidden _on an island north-west of united kingdom_ :)

Remember you can always look up infomation about commands in `Manpages` using the `man` command and help using the `--help` argument.
