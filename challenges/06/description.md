# grep

grep is used to filter text for occurence of a string! 

This command is very usefull to filter large outputs or search for text in files.

grep has some special characters built in called "metacharacters" be very careful when using these as they can 
change the output and search of grep dramatically! Look this up on google "grep metacharacters".
