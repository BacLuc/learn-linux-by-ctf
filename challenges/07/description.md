# archive

In linux systems files and folders can be combined in *archives*.

Like the well known *zip* format archives in linux are not compressed per default.

*Archives* can be compressed in several formats and with different *compressing algorithms*.

The following compressions are commonly used for diferrent purposes:
- ‘--gzip’		gzip
- ‘--bzip2’		bzip2
- ‘--xz’		xz
- ‘--lzip’		lzip
- ‘--lzma’		lzma
- ‘--lzop’		lzop
- ‘--zstd’		zstd

Using the `tar`command we can create archives and also compress them.

# Your goal
The flag for this challenge is hidden in the *information* section of an `tar` *archive*.
Find the archive and try to decompress and/or unpack it to get to know the `tar` *command*.
Don't forget to checkout the man pages if you can't find a way of using the needed tools.

# Useful commands
- tar
- cd
- ls
