# man

Manpages are used to describe Linux commands and help you understand what settings and 
arguments can be passed.
 
man is very important for daily operation of unix based systems.

You can open manpages locally by directly referencing them after the man command like:
man filename

Keep in mind you can also search in manpages, maybe this will help you.

# Your goal
You need to find the flag hidden in the local created man page.
The flag is hidden between MeP Options and some endian specific settings, happy searching!

# Useful commands
- man
- grep
