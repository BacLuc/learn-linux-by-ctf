# cd

Move between directories using the `cd` command.


When running the command `ls -l`, a list of the files in the current directory is displayed. Among that list, two special entries are present: `.` and `..` .

- `.`  marks the _current directory_.
- `..` makes the _parent directory_ - which is the directory that contains the current directory.

Run the command `pwd` in order to display the full path of your current directory(`.`).

# Your goal
