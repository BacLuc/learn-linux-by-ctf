# processes

Linux is a multitasking operating system, it launches several processes at start and when you can read this at least a `bash` *process* is running currently. 

It's important to know wher you can look for *running processes* and *investigate* their state.

You can print running processes by executing the *command* `ps` or get a live view of *running processes* with the *interactive* tool `top`.


# Your goal
Find the flag by inspecting *running processes*.
Don't forget to checkout the man pages if you can't find a way of using the needed tools.

# Useful commands
- top
- ps
- watch
